\chapter{The Environment Class}
\label{chap:environment_class}

The Environment Class (smarts/env.py) is the interface that tests will use to
load compilers, MPI installations and libraries that are specified in a
Environment.yaml file. 

Internally, the Environment Class loads and stores the Environment.yaml file
that was passed to SMARTS on launch. However, the Environment Class contains
public function which can be used to find and load modsets.

Each \testRun method of a test will be passed an instance of the Environment
class that has been loaded with the Environment.yaml that was specified by the
{\tt smarts.py} command line. Each test can use this instance of the
Environment to load modsets as they choose.

The Environment class contains two public routines which tests can use to load
modsets: \listModsets and \loadModset, which are described in the two sections
below.

\section{List Modsets}
\label{sec:list-modsets}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, 
                   caption={list\_modset Definition},
                   label={lst:list_modset_def}]
def list_modsets(self, name=None, *args, **kwargs):
    """ Return a list of modsets found in the parsed environment.yaml file, if
    name is specified then modset names that contain that name will be
    returned.

    Keyword arguments:
    name -- Name to specify specific modset(s) name (String)
    """
\end{lstlisting}

The \listModsets command can be used retrieve the names of available modsets.
These names can be used later by the \loadModset command to load specific
modsets. As seen in Listing \ref{lst:list_modset_def}, if \listModsets is ran
and {\tt name=None} then all the Modsets contained will be returned; however,
if {\tt name} is set, the Modsets that contain the name specified in name will
be retrieved.

For instance, if SMARTS was initiated with a Environment.yaml file that
contained the modsets:
{\tt
\begin{itemize}
\item GNU-9.1.0
\item GNU-8.3.0
\item INTEL-19.0.2
\end{itemize}
}

The following calls to {\tt Environment.list\_modset} would return the
following:

{\tt
\begin{itemize}
\item env.list\_modset() - ['GNU-9.1.0', 'GNU-8.3.0', 'INTEL-19.0.2']
\item env.list\_modset(name='GNU-9') - ['GNU-9.1.0']
\item env.list\_modset(name='GNU') - ['GNU-9.1.0', 'GNU-8.3.0']
\end{itemize}
}


\section{Load Modsets}
\label{sec:load-modsets}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, 
                   caption={load\_modset Definition},
                   label=load_modset_def]
def load_modset(self, modsetName, *args, **kawrgs):
    """ Completely load the modset, modsetName to be used by a single test.
    This function completely loads a modset (compiler, mpi implementation, and
    all libraries).

    To load a compiler, this function will alter the PATH environment variable
    for the current process (single test) and prepend the compiler path to it.
    If the compiler is specified as a module, it will be loaded via the
    lmod Python interface (`module python load ...`)

    MPI implementation will be loaded in a similar manner to compilers.

    Both MPI and Compilers will be checked to ensure that the correct version
    is installed by running the compiler executables specified in the
    executables section of the compiler or MPI env.yaml sections with
    `--version` and checking the versions in the env.yaml file match correctly.

    Libraries will be loaded by creating ENV_NAME as an environment variable
    and assigning to it the value specified in value.

    modsetName -- Name of the modset to be loaded (String)
\end{lstlisting}

From a modset name can be used in the \loadModset command to load a specific
compiler i.e.:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
gnu_modsets = env.list_modsets(name="GNU-9.1.0")
env.load_modset(gnu_modsets[0])
\end{lstlisting}

When \loadModset is called with a valid modset, it will load the \compiler,
\mpi and \libs section in the following order and in the following way:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Compiler}

Depending on how the compiler is specified, the compiler will either be loaded
using the lmod command or by using environment variables.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Module} - If the compiler is specified with the \module
    keyword in the Environment.yaml file then it will be loaded using the lmod
    {\tt module load} command. Doing so will alter the environment of the test
    in the same way that using the {\tt module load compiler} would alter an
    environment.
    \item \textbf{Environment Variable} - If the path of the compiler is
    specified as an environment variable, then SMARTS will prepend the
    compiler's {\tt bin} directory to the \pathenv environment variable. Which
    enables a Python's subprocess or multiprocess command to launch that
    compiler.
\end{itemize}

In both cases, SMARTS will check to see if the correct compiler version
has been loaded. This is done by running all of the executables listed in the
\executables section with {\tt --version} and checking to see if the version
specified in \version is in the output.

\item \textbf{MPI}

If specified, the MPI section will be loaded in the same way as the compiler
section above and will be tested to ensure they are loaded correctly.

\item \textbf{Libs}

Libraries will be loaded in the order that they are listed. Depending on how
the library is specified, as either a module (\module) or as an environment
variable value pair (\name, \value) the library will be loaded using the lmod
command or by creating an environment variable and setting it equal to value
listed under value.

For environment variable value pairs, SMARTS will create new environment
variables with \name (or overwrite one if the name is already present) and set
it to \value.

As opposed to how the \compiler and \mpi sections are loaded, libraries are not
tested that they are loaded correctly.

\end{enumerate}
